''' If you need to setup your project use this script
    Take a look at: https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html
    For now, we'll use directly the scripts in "./scripts"

    Execute "pip freeze > requirements.txt" in terminal to tell other people which
    packages they'll use to run your project.
